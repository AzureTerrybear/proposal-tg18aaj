Proposal for WSAD

Current systems at our disposal are: box.com and facebook.com

What are the reasons they do not meet our needs completely as platforms for content creation, editing and revising?

Box.com
Email customisation is difficult
The intranet will give users the ability to subscribe or unsubscribe to lessons on the fly
It’s a good place for our archive of lessons but it can be difficult to navigate
The intranet will only display the current lesson versions and have a link to the old lesson archive
It only has 2 options for feedback: “comment” or “add task”. Neither of these options allow for anonymous feedback and each user that needs to be informed must be typed in using @metions.
The intranet will allow users to comment feedback anonymously if preferred
Feedback that isn’t related to grammar, animations or other “need to fix” errors will be on a voting system.
The voting system will notify the content creator, content leader and co-ordinator (if applicable) about the problem i.e. lesson is too short, the activity is too difficult, some slides were confusing, etc. if there are enough votes.

Facebook.com
Facebook provides a great place to create groups but group management can be tricky with so many departments
The intranet will have a common page where ideas will be shared. 
These are ideas that can fall into two categories: “I would like to do this lesson and I need some ideas for how to make it better” and “I think we should have a lesson like this but I don’t want to do it.”
If someone picks the latter category, another teacher can select the idea. That lesson idea will be removed from the common area and added to that person’s profile in their “lessons under development” page. A notification will be sent to the content leader and co-ordinator (if applicable) of that area.
Groups will be separated by meta-data (or hashtags) and will automatically fall into their own respective group pages.
This means team cohesion can be kept intact and management/administration of the groups is kept to a minimum.

So what exactly is the intranet for?

My intranet proposal
This is going to an internal web application that will streamline content creation, editing and revising while encouraging team cohesion
The content creation process will be split into three unique steps
Step 1: Alpha lessons are in the idea and construction phase. These can be taken from the common area or created by a user. Even in the alpha stage, other teachers can provide ideas and feedback in the form of comments on the lesson.
Step 2: Beta lessons are in the pilot phase. Teachers who have taught the lesson can provide information to the content creator through feedback in the comment section or notify the creator if there are any “need to fix” errors.
Step 3: Current lessons are being used as regular lessons. Teachers can provide the same information as the beta lessons but the feedback will be on a voting system so that the content creators and leaders are not overwhelmed with notifications. During this stage, content creators, leaders and co-ordinators (if applicable) will receive notifications about problems in the lesson. This is why the voting system will be in place.
Old lessons and lessons that we do not use (i.e. VIP lessons) will revert to beta if they are in need of revision.
